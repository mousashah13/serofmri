## Goal
This Python program utilizes machine learning to predict the type of neurotransmitter expressed in fMRI data by analyzing changes in blood flow. The program uses algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks to analyze the data and make predictions. The program is trained on a dataset of fMRI data and corresponding neurotransmitter information to accurately identify patterns and relationships.

## Concept
Change in blood flow in a fMRI scan can indicate the presence of certain neurotransmitters as blood flow is tightly regulated by the neurovascular system, which responds to changes in neuronal activity. The neurovascular system increases blood flow to areas of the brain that are more active, which is detected by fMRI as an increase in signal intensity.

Different neurotransmitters have distinct effects on the neurovascular system and can therefore be associated with specific patterns of blood flow changes in the brain. For example, the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine can lead to vasodilation, causing an increase in blood flow to certain areas of the brain, while the release of the neurotransmitter serotonin can lead to vasoconstriction, causing a decrease in blood flow.

By analyzing the changes in blood flow in a fMRI scan, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns that correspond to specific neurotransmitters, allowing the prediction of the type of neurotransmitter expressed in the brain.
